		<h1>Quadrature Dev</h1>
		<p>Research and Development for digital signal processing, machine learning, and data science applied to communications, radio astronomy, and spectrum agility</p>
	</header>

	<main>
		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>
			Quadrature Dev is interested in the intersection of digital signal
			processing and data science, especially applied to problems with
			radio and wireless communications. We are interested in open source
			and have experience with PyTorch, GNU Radio, and accelerated instruction
			sets like SSE, AVX, NEON, and CUDA for GPUs.
		</p>
		<h2>Skills</h2>
		<p>
			Quadrature Dev has specialty in software development in C, C++, python, rust,
			and julia. We have targetted specialized instruction sets including CUDA for NVIDIA
			GPUs; SSE, AVX, AVX2, AVX512 for x86_64, NEON for ARM.

			We're familiar working around low-probability of intercept and detection waveforms and
			signal detectors including feature analysis and machine-learning methods. We have also
			contributed to full software modems for various waveforms and are comfortable with profiling
			tools for software optimization.
		</p>
		<h2>Services</h2>
		<p>
			Quadrature Dev is interested in developing software defined radios and novel
			applications of radio processing that leverages GPUs. We're available for
			contract development. Contact <span class="cont"></span>.

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			Quadrature Dev is the contracting/consulting entity for Nathan West. I have worked on
            projects for LPI/LPD signals analysis, machine learning and AI based spectrum awareness
            and agility, custom software modems for standard waveforms as well as AI-native communications,
            and search pipelines for doppler drifting signals in radio astronomy data for SETI.
            I have contributed to open-source software as (former) maintainer of VOLK and contributed
            to release management for GNU Radio. I am not currently accepting contract work, but have a set
            of technical hobby projects I keep up on the side. If you have an interesting project and
            want to discuss feel free to reach out to exchange ideas.
